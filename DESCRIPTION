Description: Collision Risk Models for avian fauna (seabird and migratory birds) at
    offshore wind farms. The base deterministic model is derived from 
    Band (2012) <https://tethys.pnnl.gov/publications/using-collision-risk-model-assess-bird-collision-risks-offshore-wind-farms>. 
    This was further expanded on by Masden (2015) <doi:10.7489/1659-1> and code 
    used here is heavily derived from this work with input from Dr A. Cook at the 
    British Trust for Ornithology.
