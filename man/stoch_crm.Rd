\description{
Runs a Stochastic Collision Risk Model (SCRM) for estimating the number of
in-flight collisions with offshore windfarm turbines, for given species and
windfarm scenario. Core calculations follow the work developed by \href{https://data.marine.gov.scot/dataset/developing-avian-collision-risk-model-incorporate-variability-and-uncertainty}{Masden (2015)}.
See \strong{Background and Updates} section below for more details.
}
\details{
Collision risk can be calculated under 4 options, specified by \code{model_options}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Option 1} - Basic model with proportion at
collision risk height derived from site survey (\code{prop_crh_surv}).
\item \strong{Option 2} - Basic model with proportion
at collision risk height derived from a generic flight height distribution
(\code{gen_fhd}).
\item \strong{Option 3} - Extended model using a
generic flight height distribution (\code{gen_fhd}).
\item \strong{Option 4} - Extended model using a
site-specific flight height distribution (\code{site_fhd}).
}
Where,
\itemize{
\item Basic model - assumes a uniform distribution of bird flights at
collision risk height (i.e. above the minimum and below the maximum height
of the rotor blade).
\item Extended model - takes into account the distribution of bird flight
heights at collision risk height.
}
