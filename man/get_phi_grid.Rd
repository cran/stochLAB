\title{Grid with angles between points \eqn{(x, y)} and the rotor's vertical axis}
\usage{
get_phi_grid(x_grid, y_grid)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_grid}{A 2D array, with horizontal distances \eqn{x} from the rotor's
vertical axis, expressed as the proportion of rotor radius, for the
left-half of the rotor circle area.}

\item{y_grid}{A 2D array, with vertical distances (\eqn{y} from the rotor's
horizontal axis, expressed as the proportion of rotor radius, for the
left-half of the rotor circle area.}
}
\value{
A 2D array, giving a grid of angles (in radians) between points
\eqn{(x, y)} inside the rotor circle and the rotor center, for the
left-half of the rotor circle area.
}
\description{
Given grids of vertical and horizontal distances from rotor axes
at points \eqn{(x, y)} inside the rotor circle, \code{get_phi_grid}
calculates the associated radial angles, relative to the rotor vertical axis.

Returned grid represents the left-half of the rotor's circle.
