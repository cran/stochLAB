\title{Number of collisions under model option 1}
\usage{
crm_opt1(
  flux_factor,
  prop_crh_surv,
  avg_prob_coll,
  mth_prop_oper,
  avoidance_rate,
  lac_factor
)
}
\arguments{
\item{flux_factor}{a vector containing the flux factor for each month}

\item{prop_crh_surv}{The proportion of flights at collision risk height derived
from site survey (\eqn{Q_2R}). Only required for model Option 1.}

\item{avg_prob_coll}{A numeric value, the average probability of collision for a single bird
transit through a rotor, assuming no avoidance action (\eqn{p_{average}}).}

\item{mth_prop_oper}{A numeric vector, the proportion of time during which
turbines are operational per month.}

\item{avoidance_rate}{A numeric value within the interval \eqn{[0, 1]}. The
avoidance rate, expressing the probability that a bird flying on a
collision course with a turbine will take evading action to avoid collision.}

\item{lac_factor}{A numerical value, the large array correction factor.
Defaults to 1, meaning large array correction is not applicable.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector, the expected number of collisions per month based
on model option 1
}
\description{
Wrapper function to run CRM calculations under option 1:
\itemize{
\item Basic model, i.e. flights across collision risk height are
uniformly distributed.
\item Proportion at collision risk height derived from site survey.
}
