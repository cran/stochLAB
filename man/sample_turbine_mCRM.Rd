\usage{
sample_turbine_mCRM(
  rtn_speed_pars,
  bld_pitch_pars,
  rtr_radius_pars,
  bld_width_pars,
  season_specs,
  n_iter = 10,
  trb_wind_avbl,
  trb_downtime_pars
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rtn_speed_pars}{A single row data frame with columns \code{mean} and \code{sd},
the mean and standard deviation of the rotation speed.}

\item{bld_pitch_pars}{A single row data frame with columns \code{mean} and \code{sd},
the mean and standard deviation of the blade pitch angle,
i.e. the angle between the blade surface and the rotor plane,
in degrees. Assumed to follow a \emph{tnorm-lw0} distribution.}

\item{rtr_radius_pars}{A single row data frame with columns \code{mean} and \code{sd},
the mean and standard deviation of the radius of the rotor, in metres.
Assumed to follow a \emph{tnorm-lw0} distribution.}

\item{bld_width_pars}{A single row data frame with columns \code{mean} and \code{sd},
the mean and standard deviation of the maximum blade width, in metres.
Assumed to be \emph{tnorm-lw0} distribution.}

\item{season_specs}{A data frame
defining the seasons for aggregating over collision estimates. It must
comprise the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{season_id}, (unique) season identifier,
\item \code{start_month}, name of the season's first month,
\item \code{end_month}, name of the season's last month.
}}

\item{n_iter}{An integer value. The number of samples to generate}

\item{trb_wind_avbl}{A data frame with the monthly estimates of operational
wind availability. It must contain the columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{month}, (unique) month names,
\item \code{pctg}, the percentage of time wind conditions allow for turbine operation
per month.
}}

\item{trb_downtime_pars}{A data frame with monthly estimates of maintenance
downtime, assumed to follow a \emph{tnorm-lw0} distribution. It
must contain the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{month}, (unique) month names,
\item \code{mean}, numeric, the mean percentage of time in each month when turbines
are not operating due to maintenance,
\item \code{sd}, the standard deviation of monthly maintenance downtime.
}}
}
\value{
A data frame of all the information sampled for the turbine with nrow = n_iter
}

Samples and aggregates appropriate data for a single wind turbine
